# Checkers_Playing_Agents
Implemented a minimax algorithm for two adversarial agents and a graphical interface for the Checkers game.<br />
In this checkers game, only double jumps are included and if pieces from one side, make it to the last row of the other side of the board, they are converted to king pieces which unlike normal pieces can move both forwards and backwards.
